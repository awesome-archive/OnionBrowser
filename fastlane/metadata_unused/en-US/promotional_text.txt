Welcome to Onion Browser 2!

Onion Browser 2 is a total rewrite of the app which contains several new features:

* A friendlier first-time launch experience.
* An updated user interface, containing "tabbed browsing" and improved settings panels
* HTTPS Everywhere support
* Built-in ad-blocking and privacy protection
* Tweak security/privacy settings on a per-site basis (including cookie policy, user agent, and JavaScript/active content policy).
* Tor 0.3.5.8
* Settings and bookmarks from Onion Browser 1 are retained.

Best of all: this update is free!

The Onion Browser 2 update was supported by the Guardian Project, with help from Benjamin Erhart and Carrie Winfrey. Onion Browser 2 is based on the open-source "Endless" Browser; special thanks to Joshua Stein for creating Endless and for granting permission to use it in Onion Browser. See the credits file in the app settings for more information.
